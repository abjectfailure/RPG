\subsection*{Talent}
Your initial training results in a minor talent. Choose one of the following options. You cannot choose the same talent more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

\subsubsection{Fist Fighting}
You've been in enough brawls to be able to effectively use your body as a weapon. Your unarmed strikes are now considered a weapon that you are proficient with, and their damage is increased to 1d2. Additionally, whenever you would normally make an attack, you may choose to make two unarmed strikes instead.

\subsection*{Inner Light}

Your inner reserve of Qi starts to manifest in ways that begin to affect the world around you rather than just your own body. At level three, choose three spells from the Adept's spell list, one of power one, one of power five, and one of power seven. You do not learn how to cast these spells. However, from this point forward, whenever your Qi reserve is equal to or higher than one of those spells, you gain that spell's respective minor imbue power.
