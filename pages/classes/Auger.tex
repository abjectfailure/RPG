\subsection*{Better Lucky Than Good}
At level two, you learn how to subtly manipulate fate to your advantage. At the beginning of each encounter roll a d20 and store the result. During that encounter, whenever you roll a d20, you may choose to replace the die rolled with a stored die. You are considered to have naturally rolled the value of the stored die and the rolled die is now stored instead.

\subsection*{Mystic Vision}
When you reach third level, your connection to fate allows you to glimpse into the near future and even to make slight changes to affect your fortune. Choose a spell from the Auger spell list. You know that spell.

As an action, if one of your die results in your Luck Pool is greater than or equal to the power of a single-target spell you know, you can remove that die result from the pool for the rest of the encounter in order to cast that spell. 

Then, for every multiple of the spell power that the die result is greater than, the spell effects an additional target of your choice within range. As an example, if you use a die result of twenty to cast a spell of power five, the spell would effect four targets.
