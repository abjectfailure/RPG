\subsection*{Personality}

Myrmidonian personalities will vary between their different castes. Drones are subservient, willing to take orders from anyone close to them, but are weak-willed and will tend to shy away from combat. Soldiers are still likely to take orders, however only from those in a leadership position. Subtlety is almost unknown to them, combined with a one track mind, meaning they often cause more problems than they can solve.
