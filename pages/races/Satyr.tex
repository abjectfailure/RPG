\subsection*{Physical Description}

Satyrs are roughly Human-sized at five and a half to six feet tall, weighing about 140 to 190 pounds. They have hoofed feet and a light coat of rough brown hair covering their entire body, leading up to a thick mane about their head. 

Saytrs have two horns that extrude from the top of their skull. A female’s horns will be small points, only about two or three inches long. Males have curved horns that wrap around their pointed ears. A male’s horns grow as they age, so their length is a good indication of how old a Saytr is.
