\subsection*{Background}

Narashima are primal hunters that live in packs throughout the jungles. A feline race, Narashima are naturally cunning and dexterous.

\subsection*{Physical Description}

Narashima are feline humanoids standing about five and a quarter to six and a quarter feet tall, weighing between 140 and 220 pounds. Their coats come in a variety of colors and patterns from all black to all white, spotted to striped to muddled. A Narashima’s coat will generally tell you what pack they are from, though in more recent times inter-pack marriages are becoming more common, thus confusing this system.

\subsection*{Personality}

Narashima are always looking for a challenge as a means of proving themselves to their tribe and their race. Yet, they are not a headstrong race ready to rush into any battle, but rather cold, calculating hunters wanting to learn what they can about their prey and environment before taking action.

Narashima believe themselves to be the current pinnacle evolutionary form and are contemptuous of the other intelligent races. This disregard doesn’t extend all the way towards blanket hatred though, as Narashima are willing to accept and respect individuals who have shown themselves to be capable. However, this does mean that a Narashima will have difficulty taking orders from any other races and will automatically try to assume any leadership position, especially during battle.
