\subsection*{Background}

Spriggans are a race of sentient, mobile vines that grow in swamplands. Evolving from a primitive shambling mass, Spriggans took humanoid form shortly after finding out about other sentient races. Since then, Spriggans have formed a fully functional society and grown drastically in their sophistication.

This quick growth in complexity is thanks in large part to the Spriggans’ hereditary memory. Spriggans reproduce by cutting, an asexual means of reproduction whereby a member of the race will remove a small vine from their body and graft it around a “heart” made usually of wood, mud, and plant matter. The original sprout will grow around and through the “heart” which then forms the basis of intellect for the future Spriggan, which means that some part of the “parent’s” memory is then passed on to the child. 

Kodama are a mobile mushroom race that has spread out to a variety of different climates. Their race originally developed in temperate forests, evolving from one of the myriad types of fungus that grow around the roots of the trees. Their hardiness has allowed them to spread into brushlands, jungles,  and swamps, though they generally prefer darker, shaded regions.

Kodama live in the hollowed out trunks of the oldest and largest trees in their forests. This naturalistic homesteading combined with their short stature make them easy to overlook in the forest and indeed their existence was considered something of a myth or legend before formal contact was made.

\subsection*{Physical Description}

Spriggans appear to be a constantly shifting mass of vines assembled in the shape and size of a Human male. This form can be modified, but to do so takes a large amount of time and considerable effort and so cannot be done on a whim. Though Spriggans lack eyes, they are able to process the light that they photosynthesize. This allows them to see in every direction simultaneously, however at a limited range.

Kodama weigh between 35 and 60 pounds and grow to a height of around three feet. They have a soft, spongy flesh that can range from a pure white to a muddy brown. Their torso and upper limbs are very thin, but bulge outward as you move towards the extremities. On top of their head will be a “cap” whose size will indicate the general age of the Kodama.

Underneath this “cap”, Kodama will have two or three sensory buds. These florescent orbs take in and process both light and sound. All along the Kodama’s body will be pores that both release and act as receptors to pheromones. Occasionally, one of these pores will become clogged by spores released by the Kodama and a mushroom cap will develop and grow. These sprouts act as benign tumors rather than any sort of asexual reproduction and fall off the Kodama after a couple of weeks.

\subsection*{Personality}

Spriggans are a curious race. They are constantly looking to learn from others and seek out new experiences. This makes them natural adventurers and great party members, but also makes them more reluctant to take a leadership position.

Kodama are very determined and patient. They are not ones to be deterred from a goal, even if the payoff is far in the future. This leads to a reluctance to take a quick and easy way of doing a task, noting something similar to the Human expression, “If you’re going to do something, might as well do it right.”

In relations with other races, Kodama are more than willing to follow directions. They do not have the same animosity towards taking orders that many of the other races do and will tend to have a slight bemusement over those other races’ “bickerings”.
