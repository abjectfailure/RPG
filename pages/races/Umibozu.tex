\subsection*{Background}

Umibozu are amphibious humanoids living in underwater cities strewn across the ocean floor. Originally, a terrestrial race, sometime in the past their bodies adapted towards living in the water. While they are perfectly capable of living on land still, Umibozu much prefer large expanses of water.

\subsection*{Physical Description}

Umibozu are pale, bluish purple creatures. Due to their constant swimming, they have developed a smooth, rubbery skin to reduce drag and long fingers and feet to help propel themselves. Their bodies have lost all external sensory appendages like ears and noses in order to reduce drag. Small slits in their skull are all that remains from their evolutionary predecessors.  

On an Umibozu’s back lie large horizontal slits in two columns, these are their gills. While in the water, these will open allowing their body to filter the water. While on land they close, and the same structures that drew oxygen out of the water, now bind to oxygen in the air the Umibozu draws into it’s body from it’s nose. Because of this system, an Umibozu cannot have it’s nose and gills open at the same time.

Umibozu stand slightly taller than a human at around six feet on average, however their internal anatomy is much different and so only weigh between 120 and 140 pounds. This difference in anatomy also makes them more frail than many of the other races, with the average Umibozu living until only around sixty years of age.

\subsection*{Personality}

Umibozu are incredibly secretive about their society and “lands”, and will only rarely answer questions about their past. However, they are not xenophobic towards outside cultures, they very much enjoy learning about other races. Though, this is the same curiosity that a human might have towards primitive cultures. 

Umibozu have such an ancient, formalized, and ritualistic culture that many others seem positively simplistic by comparison. This means that Umibozu may come off as a bit condescending, but they are very polite about it.
